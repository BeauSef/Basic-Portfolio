        <p>My name is Beau Hunter. I am defintly apart of JazzNation which is a very elite group.
            I love to workout and have been pretty dang consistnt until I meet nachos and beer. On the weekends i'm found playing basketball, watching movies and sports, 
            and haveing a beer. I sometimes play games like NBA2k or Call of Duty. I enjoy traveling and going to the beach, within the past 2 years I have been to Flordia, San Diego
            Washington, and Vegas. Im hoping to be able to have a house by the beach once I get my exciting new career started in development. 
         </p>
